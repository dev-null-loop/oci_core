# DRG  Attachments  for  virtual  circuits, IPSec  tunnels,  and  remote
# peering connections  are created  (and deleted) automatically  on your
# behalf when  you create  (or delete) the  network object.  Hence, this
# management resource is used to update these types of autogenerated DRG
# Attachments.  The user cannot create DRG attachments of these types as
# needed.
